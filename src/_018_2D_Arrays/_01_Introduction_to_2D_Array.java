    /*
        A 2D array (two-dimensional array) is a structured way to store data in a matrix-like format, using rows and columns.
        It extends the concept of a 1D array, which stores data linearly, into a grid structure.

Characteristics of 2D Arrays
- Structure: Data is stored in rows and columns.
- Indexing: Each element is accessed using two indices â€“ one for the row and one for the column.
- Fixed Size: The size of the array must be declared at initialization in languages like C and Java.
- Efficient Storage: Useful for tabular data, image processing, and graphs.
